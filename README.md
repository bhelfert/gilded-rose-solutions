Gilded Rose Refactoring Challenge
=================================

This is a Java refactoring challenge that job candidates applying for a Java developer position at <company> have to take and pass.

The candidate should work on it for one hour while we are watching and having a conversation with the candidate about all the things
he is doing and he is maybe thinking. The candidate should feel more like having a Pair Programming session than taking a coding challenge.

One hour might be too short for that challenge so you can split the time up into two 30 minutes pieces:
one for writing tests and one for refactoring the legacy code (assuming that all tests have been written, even if they haven't).

This Maven project comes with JUnit and AssertJ but the candidate is free to choose/add whatever "standard" library he likes, e.g.
Cucumber if he wants to write more expressive tests using e.g. [Data Tables](https://cucumber.io/docs/reference#data-tables). But keep an eye on
that the candidate is not struggling with the tools instead of writing code!

To understand what this challenge is all about, take a look on the requirements file (GildedRoseRequirements.txt) - it will tell you the context.
The project has been heavily inspired by the MMORPG "World of Warcraft" so it makes use of its domain-specific language ;).
